# Bankruptcy Prediction with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to predict corporate bankruptcy using synthetic financial data and machine learning algorithms. It compares the performance of three classification models:

- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

Each model is trained, evaluated, and its classification report is printed for performance analysis.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“Š Key Concepts
- Overfitting detection and mitigation
- Cross-validation and model evaluation
- Binary classification metrics

This repository was created as part of my freelancing portfolio to demonstrate my skills in machine learning model building and evaluation.
